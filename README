# Outline:
1. **Web Framework:**
   - ASP.NET Core: This is a popular and modern framework for building web applications using C#. It is cross-platform, open-source, and has good community support.
   - I can use ASP.NET Core to create both the back-end (server-side logic) and the front-end (using technologies like Razor Pages or a front-end framework like Angular, React, or Vue.js).

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Fetch Prayer Times: Integrate with this API: https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api
   - User Authentication: Implement user accounts if you want to provide personalized features or notifications.
   - Consider incorporating additional features like Qibla direction, Islamic calendar, or other relevant information.

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Design a user-friendly interface that displays prayer times clearly.
   - Implement responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across various devices.
   - Consider adding features like location detection to automatically determine the user's location or allowing users to set their preferred location.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Choose a hosting solution for the web app. Azure, AWS, and other cloud platforms are common choices for hosting ASP.NET Core applications. I may use github pages for this initially.
   - Configure a domain and set up SSL for secure communication.
